<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![img](assets/pr-demo.png)](https://github.com/Advik-B/Desktop-launcher)

Dekstop launcher is an alternative to the native windows desktop.
This is because the native windows desktop is not very customizable and is not very user friendly.
This project aims to solve this problem by providing a customizable and user friendly desktop. (More like a BIG start menu)

More features will be added in the future. Please feel free to suggest any features in the issues section.
